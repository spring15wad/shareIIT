SUBJECT: Project 2: Beta

Professor Stolley,

We would like to start this memo by providing some much needed information about Project 2: Beta. After careful deliberation we have decided to start Project 2 from scratch and not proceed with any of the apps that we presented to the rest of the class last Tuesday. 

Share IIT! is a community sharing app that allows for a small community to share items of interest without the exchange of money. Our app will allow students to borrow items they might only need one time during their four or five year stay at Illinois Institute of Technology. We would like to connect students that are in possession of items with students that are in need/search of such items in an effort to reduce unnecessary purchases and facilitate more interactions within the community.  With this app students can share things like books, toasters, waffle makers, bicycles, and calculators. 

The app will ask users to create a profile for a variety of purposes and a login for security purposes.

Execution:


Important step is to get the associations and models right. Setup the queries and strictly follow the ‘DRY’ ideology.

1) Creating models and getting their associations right will be our first step
2) Creating sketches and working on the UI as it will be important as it will give us a feel of how we want our app to navigate through various options and how we can improve the logic based on our UI
3) Follow agile methodology and adding functionalities to the app after testing it out individually and then testing the entire app after integrating the functionality
4) Setting deadlines to roll out releases of our app with added features

We have attached a class diagram for your reference. It is not the final version and there will be a lot of changes along the way.


Thank you for your assistance.
Javier, Neeraj, and Steve
