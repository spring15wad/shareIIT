Execution:


Important step is to get the associations and models right. Setup the queries and strictly follow the ‘DRY’ ideology.

1) Creating models and getting their associations right will be our first step
2) Creating sketches and working on the UI as it will be important as it will give us a feel of how we want our app to navigate through various options and how we can improve the logic based on our UI
3) Follow agile methodology and adding functionalities to the app after testing it out individually and then testing the entire app after integrating the functionality
4) Setting deadlines to roll out releases of our app with added features

We have attached a class diagram for your reference. It is not the final version and there will be a lot of changes along the way.


Thank you for your assistance.
